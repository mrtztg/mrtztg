### Hi there, I'm Morteza 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience specializing in Java and Golang. I excel in building scalable, high-performance systems and leading engineering teams to deliver innovative solutions.

This platform allows me to share my technical expertise and engage with a community of like-minded professionals.
